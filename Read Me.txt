To run the project, navigate into "PMurphy_6016_Project1" and run the "PMurphy_6016_Project1.sln"

Make sure that "ChatServer" is the startup project; right click it and select "Set as Startup Project" if you need to.  It should be colored in bold, when it is selected.  Then click "Local Windows Debugger" to run the server.

You'll need to run 1 copy of the "ChatServer.exe", and any number of "ChatClient.exe" copies you'd like.  (Note:  The ChatServer.exe must be run before any of the clients; and must be left running until all of the clients are closed.)

To run a chat client, you'll need to go back to the folder, and navigate further to the x64 file, then either Debug or Release.  (Depends what option you ran the server on.)  click on "ChatClient.exe" to run a Client window; and open it multiple times, to run several Clients. 

Enter a name into a Client window, and then you'll be able to send messages to the other Client windows.  Type "/exit" to close a Client window.  (Do not close it by hitting the 'X' in the top corner.)  Once all the Client windows have been closed, you can close the Server window by hitting the 'X'.
